## Description
- Represented road network as an undirected Weighted Graph & built an application to serve user requests for route navigation
- Optimized building time for network re-construction by applying Prim's Algorithm for identification of Minimum Spanning Tree
- Implemented Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm for calculations of the shortest route from source junction to destination entered by a user
